                Private Notes is a web app where, once users have created an
                account, they can write and store their own thoughts safely.
                This app is not intended to be a real application; it was made
                just for learning purposes.
            </p>
            <p>
                The app is composed of three main parts: frontend, backend, and
                a database. The frontend is built with HTML and CSS. For the
                backend, I used Python libraries such as FastAPI and SQLModel,
                and MySQL was my database of choice.
