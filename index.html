            <h2 class="Subtitle">About Me</h2>
            <p>
                Hi! I'm Juan Cruz from Argentina, a Junior Data Scientist
                currently in my final year at Siglo 21 University, where I'll
                soon be graduating as a Data Scientist. I'm passionate about
                coding, whether it's for data analysis, automating tasks, web
                scraping, or building applications, both desktop and web-based.
            </p>
            <p>
                Regarding data science, I have experience in all stages of the
                data lifecycle. I can collect data using web scraping tools like
                Scrapy, BeautifulSoup, and Selenium, and then process and
                analyze it using Python libraries such as Pandas. I also enjoy
                creating clear, meaningful data visualizations and building
                machine learning models with Scikit-learn.
            </p>
            <p>
                My first job was at Latam Connect, where I worked on data
                extraction and processing. I also automated tasks by integrating
                Python with Google Sheets, which helped me develop strong skills
                in data management and creating efficient solutions.
            </p>
            <p>
                I realized that Data Science is about discovering insights,
                while Backend development is about building solutions. This is
                why I have chosen to pursue a career path focused on Backend
                development. Currently, <strong>I’m looking for new
                    opportunities to continue growing and applying my skills to
                    different projects. I’m particularly interested in Python
                    backend positions, and my framework of choice is
                    FastAPI.</strong> Moreover, when I'm working with databases,
                I
                use SQLModel, a Python library for ORM. I understand SQL, and
                for my projects, I work with relational databases like SQLite
                and MySQL.

                April 2024
            </p>
            <p>
                I worked as an intern at a successful Spanish company called
                Latam Connect. My role was as a Data Analyst, and I was
                responsible for extracting data from the web and delivering it
                in Excel format. At that time, we used Google Sheets a lot, and
                part of my job was to manually add information to enrich the
                data. This task could take hours, especially with large amounts
                of data. To solve this, I found a way to integrate Python with
                Google Sheets. I created a script that performed Google searches
                based on queries made from other columns in the sheet. This
                automation saved us a lot of time and made the process much more
                efficient.
