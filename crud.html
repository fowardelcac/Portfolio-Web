        <section>
            <p>This is a CRUD project, and it can be defined as follows: CRUD is
                an
                acronym for Create, Read, Update, and Delete. Each of these
                performs
                a different operation, but they all aim to track and manage data
                from a database. I developed this CRUD project using Python code
                and
                MySQL as the database. I used a library called SQLModel, which
                is
                similar to SQLAlchemy, but the key difference is its integration
                with Pydantic.
            </p>
            <p> In my case, I chose this library because it is easier to
                integrate
                with FastAPI, as they share the same creator. This CRUD app is
                designed for an ice cream shop, allowing the user to insert data
                for
                products and weekly purchases. It is a very simple database that
                contains three tables:</p>

            <p><ul>
                    <li><p>Product: Contains all the possible products.</p></li>
                    <li><p>Purchase: Records weekly purchases of raw
                            materials.</p></li>
                    <li><p>Receipt: Contains the receipt data. I created this
                            table
                            to
                            minimize
                            redundancy in the second table. Without it, if a
                            weekly
                            purchase
                            includes 15 different ice cream flavors on the same
                            receipt,
                            the
                            receipt data would be repeated 15 times.</p></li>
                </ul></p>

            <p> My Python code is organized into classes. Initially, I planned
                to
                create a class for each table, but then I realized that this
                would
                result in repetitive code (each class would have the same CRUD
                operations). So, I changed my approach. I developed a class for
                each
                CRUD operation, so each class is responsible for just one CRUD
                action. To test the application, I included tests using pytest,
                which test each function.</p>
